# PHP composer example

This small demo site shows how the `zeroad.network/token` PHP composer module works and how you can add it to your own project.

## Try it yourself

Follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```shell
   composer install
   ```
1. Start the demo site:
   ```shell
   composer start
   ```
1. Open the homepage: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

   To view the raw `tokenContext` JSON output, open: [http://localhost:8080/token](http://localhost:8080/token).

If you do not have the Zero Ad Network browser extension installed and do not have an active subscription, the demo will show how an average visitor would experience the site: cookie prompts, marketing popups, fake trackers, ads, paywalls, and subscription requests.

## How to test with the browser extension

To test the demo without buying a subscription:

1. Click **Get browser extension** in the top navigation and install the extension for your browser.
1. After installing, click **Get demo token**. This opens a Zero Ad Network developer page that should automatically sync a demo token to your extension. The demo token is valid for 7 days. Revisit the page to renew the token for another 7 days.
1. Now reload the page.

The demo token uses the **Freedom** subscription plan so you can see the full feature set when both the site and the user have matching features.

## Final notes

This example should help you set up Zero Ad Network on your site.
